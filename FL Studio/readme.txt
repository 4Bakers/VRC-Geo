ok so basically the idea is instead of everpresent BGM, have invisible triggers like exploration and maybe some currently-nonexistent ideas for world interactions to trigger a musical audio segment no longer than, say, 30 seconds (excluding fade in and fade out).
the intent behind this is to make the world feel emptier. if there is music playing all of the time, there's too much going on for the empty feeling I want to invoke.
the issue with this is that it puts a lot more weight on good soundscape design, but I think I can handle it.

I'm figuring this out while I'm typing it, so please forgive my incomplete thoughts.
I was thinking of something ethereal and haunting, but not scary? if that makes any sense.
I'm NOT a music person, so I just googled "C chords cheat sheet" and put down what I saw because I remember hearing that C Maj is generally is easy and might be helpful to achieve my idea, but in its current state the music is VERY TEMPORARY and just to get ideas down.
(this is the FIRST TIME I've ever done this lmao)

NOTE: not all of these have to have melodies! just a few chords of backing strings might be interesting for smaller ones
